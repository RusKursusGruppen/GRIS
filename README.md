# How to install:
install python3 through your package manager  
install sqlite3 through your package manager  
install pip (python-pip or python3-pip) through your package manager  
sudo pip install virtualenv (might be necessary)  

Get the GRIS repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:RusKursusGruppen/GRIS.git
```

Run the setup script
```
./setup
```

Create a config file
```
cp config-example.py config.py
```

Create a database, while standing in the GRIS dir:
```
./admin/test_db.sh
```

Start the build in webserver:
```
./gris
```

Visit the page in your browser at
```
localhost:5000
```

## Ubuntu:
Beaware that python defaults to python2 in ubuntu!

When the setup script detects that you are running on an ubuntu system or you
call it with as follows, pip will get downloaded manually by the script.
```./setup ubuntu```


On ubuntu you might also have to install:  
python3.3-dev  
libffi-dev  
libevent-dev  
libmemcached-dev  
and use ./setup-ubuntu instead  

## Bcrypt
if bcrypt is not working on arch linux you might try the following:
```
sudo cp /usr/lib/ffi.h /usr/local/include
sudo cp /usr/lib/libffi.so /usr/local/lib
sudo cp /usr/lib/libffi-3.0.13/include/ffitarget.h /usr/local/include
sudo cp /usr/lib/libffi-3.0.13/include/ffi.h /usr/local/include
```

# Working on GRIS
The webserver will automatically detect changes in files, there is no need to restart it manually all the time.

See how-to-work-on-gris.md in the docs folder for the preferred workflow.
